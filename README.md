Project Overview: 


Founded by two veterans at Frontier Capital Management, Assette delivers comprehensive software solutions to assist its clients with their financial data management. Assette’s current processing procedure refreshes its client databases on a batch basis, however, there remains possibilities that Assette receives data that has not been properly curated. In an attempt to increase Assette’s business processing efficiency, our team’s mission is to develop a series of statistical validations to detect anomalies in data submitted during the ingestion process.
